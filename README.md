this is just a game I created when I was in 10th class<br>
It is fun to play as the game is very simple and does not have any complex objective<br>
You are a box that runns on a cuboid shaped box floating in air<br>
There are colour changing box of different shapes that you have to avoid<br>
You lose if you hit them<br>
Try to create a new highscore
